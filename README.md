This is from a study that utilises the Facial Expression Recognition 
2013 (FER-13) dataset, consisting of 35,888 images, with a focus 
on training, testing, and deploying a faciel emotion recognition model. The 
CNN codes involve image preprocessing, feature 
extraction, model training, and fine-tuning. Various 
experiments were conducted to optimise hyperparameters and 
assess model performance, including testing with different 
optimizers, batch sizes, learning rates, and loss functions. 
Despite limitations in computing power and dataset size, the 
study provides insights into the challenges and potential 
improvements for enhancing FER accuracy.
